## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi! I’m a beginner who’s passionate about learning full-stack development. 

While building this:

- I worked on each part separately: frontend, backend, and admin dashboard
- Connecting all three components and deploying them together was challenging
- Faced hurdles during deployment (especially with Vercel & environment setup)

But I’m **committed to keep learning and improving**, and I plan to build more such projects that are useful, functional, and more robust over time.
